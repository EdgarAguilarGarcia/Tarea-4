                        <p>In 2010, Big Floppa anonymously released his first single, "Big Floppa". The track turned out to be a success. It kickstarted his career, boosted his morale, and increased his work ethic. In 2011, Big Floppa and Justin contacted Bella, an old friend, to help fund them to make an album. Bella agreed and helped them with pieces of equipment. Big Floppa also asked Sogga, Mike, and Baweley to help them. At first, Sogga did not believe that Big Floppa made "Big Floppa", but then he agreed to join. The team pulled together and wrote nine tracks, released as the album "Flop Fo No Hoe".

                            Big Floppa and his friends wrote the lyrics carefully and secretly to avoid leaks. Unfortunately, there is an unconfirmed leak in YouTube that could be seen below. </p>

                       
                        <p>A month after the release, Big Floppa moved to Detroit, where he founded the Floppa Clan, which consists of the most hardcore Big Floppa fans and supporters. There, they met with Floppa Crips Gang, their archenemy. Big Floppa started to become an icon of the United Flops, both in art and politics, for some reason.
                            2015-2019: Live concerts, tours, and death
                            
                            Big Floppa started his first tour in late 2015, where he travelled across the United Flops. The tour was named "The Big Floppa Tour". He first travelled to his hometown Miami, where his father was called onto the stage. He then travelled up north to Flopington DC and then to Phoolapelphia. Then, he got to New Flop City, Cleveland, and then Detroit. His final stop was Chicago.
                            
                            Big Floppa's last and second tour was called "Big Floppa Goes International!", where he went to Europe and big countries. He went to most of Europe, Flopxico, Sogada, Floppaslavia, Flopan, and Bingustralia.
                            
                            On December 26 2019, after Big Floppa's death, some theorized that Big Floppa escaped to Brazil instead of succumbing to fatal wounds in a hospital bed. However, many believe this theory to be rejected due to witness testimony placing Big Floppa's corpse in the suspected vehicle. The world ended up losing the most influential and inspiring artist that anyone had ever seen, causing a riot lasting two days. </p>

                        <p>On December 23th, 2019, Big Floppa was sequentially found dead after a drive-by shooting on 63rd Street, Detroit. Released medical documents account for 16 gunshot wounds, leaving him in a critical state. The renowned musician was rushed to a surrounding hospital where he would later be pronounced dead after succumbing to his injuries. The official cause of death was reported as low oxygen caused by pneumothorax coupled with catastrophic injury to the heart and major blood vessels, leading to lethal blood loss. This artist shall live on in our hearts. May he flop in peace. </p>
